## WhatsApp Chat Fetcher

The WhatsApp Message Integration project aims to incorporate WhatsApp text, voice, and recorded messages into a Laravel application. This integration will enable the application to receive and process messages sent to a connected WhatsApp account. Node.js can optionally be used to handle real-time processing and WebSocket-based message updates.
